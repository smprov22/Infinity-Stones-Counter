# unit-4-game

This is a variation on the "Crystal Collector" game.  I themed my game after the infinity stones from the Avengers universe.  There are actually 6 infinity stones, but for simplicity sake, I only used 4. Each stone has a random value between 0 and 12, but that value is hidden from the player.  The only way to find the value is to click on each stone.  Each time you click on a stone, the value of that stone is added to the "Stone Counter" tally. There is also a randomly generated number, between 19 and 120.  The object of the game is to have the total of the stones equal the randomly generated number.  If you match the number, you win, if you go over the total, you lose.

I created this game using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.  It was challenging, but once I got past the first hiccup the rest came together fairly quickly.
